GET /repos/:owner/:repo/stats/contributors
As you notice in the comments, the ":" shouldn't be included.

curl --include https://api.github.com/users/caspyin
Pass user credential to basic auth to access protected resources like a users starred gists, or private info associated with their profile

curl --user "caspyin:PASSWD" https://api.github.com/gists/starred
curl --user "caspyin:PASSWD" https://api.github.com/users/caspyin
Passing just the username without the colon (:) will cause you to be prompted for your account password.
This avoids having your password in your command line history

curl --user "caspyin" https://api.github.com/users/caspyin
In your case, replacing <owner> and <reponame> by the right owner and repo names:

curl https://api.github.com/repos/<owner>/<reponame>/stats/contributors

GET /repos/:owner/:repo/stats/contributors
As you notice in the comments, the ":" shouldn't be included.

curl --include https://api.github.com/users/caspyin
Pass user credential to basic auth to access protected resources like a users starred gists, or private info associated with their profile

curl --user "caspyin:PASSWD" https://api.github.com/gists/starred
curl --user "caspyin:PASSWD" https://api.github.com/users/caspyin
Passing just the username without the colon (:) will cause you to be prompted for your account password.
This avoids having your password in your command line history

curl --user "caspyin" https://api.github.com/users/caspyin
In your case, replacing <owner> and <reponame> by the right owner and repo names:

curl https://api.github.com/repos/<owner>/<reponame>/stats/contributors

GET /repos/:owner/:repo/stats/contributors
As you notice in the comments, the ":" shouldn't be included.

curl --include https://api.github.com/users/caspyin
Pass user credential to basic auth to access protected resources like a users starred gists, or private info associated with their profile

curl --user "caspyin:PASSWD" https://api.github.com/gists/starred
curl --user "caspyin:PASSWD" https://api.github.com/users/caspyin
Passing just the username without the colon (:) will cause you to be prompted for your account password.
This avoids having your password in your command line history

curl --user "caspyin" https://api.github.com/users/caspyin
In your case, replacing <owner> and <reponame> by the right owner and repo names:

curl https://api.github.com/repos/<owner>/<reponame>/stats/contributors
